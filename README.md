# cytoGraphDB
CytographDB is a graphical browser designed for intuitive visual exploration of physical data models stored in any PostgreSQL instance.

The name is derived from our use of the [Cytoscape JavaScript library](http://js.cytoscape.org/), which we thank for its open availability.



The simple graph below is taken from the test database used in this documentation and can be easily reproduced.
