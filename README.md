# cytoGraphDB
CytographDB is a graphical browser designed for intuitive visual exploration of physical data models stored in any PostgreSQL instance.

The name is derived from our use of the [Cytoscape JavaScript library](http://js.cytoscape.org/), which we thank for its open availability.

The simple graph below comes from a small database used for documentation purposes and can be easily reproduced:
