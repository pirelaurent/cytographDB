## Overview

**CytographDB** transforms a PostgreSQL schema into an interactive, directed graph using schema introspection:

- Each **table** is represented as a **node**
- Each **foreign key** is rendered as a **directed edge** between nodes

This graph-based representation supports large and complex schemas, with color-coded links that enhance the visibility of table relationships.

With powerful selection, filtering, and path traversal features—spanning both visible and hidden graph layers—CytographDB helps users to:

- Visualize and explore table dependencies  
- Identify logical and functional consistency domains  
- Detect and document business aggregates  
- Save and reload business-relevant subsets to communicate the model effectively
