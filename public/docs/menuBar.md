# Menu Bar

![All Menus](./img/allMenus.png)

Menus and submenus appear on hover and disappear when the cursor leaves.  
üí° **Tip:** Click on a menu entry to keep it temporarily open.

---

## <img src ="../img/rollback2.png" height =20px/> Undo

The **counterclockwise arrow** restores the previous state of the graph after an action.  
You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl Z**.
Notice shortcut **Ctrl Y** can restore backward. 

---

## <img src ="../img/redCapture.png" height =25px/> PNG Snapshot

This button captures the current view and prompts you to download it as a PNG image.      
The edges are temporarily enhanced in the graph image so they are more visible when printing.      
You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl G** ‚Äî useful for taking a snapshot without moving the mouse outside the graph.   

---
## <img src="../img/clipShort.png" height =30px/> <img src = "../img/clipFull.png" height =30px/> &nbsp; Clip Report

These icons show empty and filled in clipped data that echoes results of actions.    
A click will diplay the last clipped content in a new tab to quickly browse results.    .

## üîé Select Mode: OR / AND  
<img src ="./img/and-or.png" height =40px/>

- **OR (default):** Adds new elements to the current selection.
- **AND:** Applies the selection **only to already selected elements**, resulting in an AND operation.

üí° **Tip:** Switch back to **OR** after using **AND**, otherwise further selections may return no results.

--- 

## Hover Toggle 
<img src ="./img/hoverToggle.png" height =35px/>

Displays element details when the cursor hovers over nodes or edges.

### Perimeter of Actions

- If some visible nodes are **selected**, actions apply only to them.
- If none are selected, actions apply to the entire visible graph.

The status bar shows the current scope with highlighted numbers:

 **No selection** ‚Üí the action applies to all nodes (e.g., 9 in `democytodb`):  
  <img src= "./img/scope9.png" width = '200px'>

  **Selection of 4 nodes** ‚Üí the action applies only to those 4:  
  <img src= "./img/scope4.png" width = '200px'>

# Database Access 

## <img src= "./img/DBmenu.png">

The main purpose of **CytographDB** is to create a graph from an available PostgreSQL database.  
### <img src= "./img/createGraphMenu.png">

- A dropdown with all available databases is displayed.
- Choose one and click **OK** to generate the graph.

# File Access 

## <img src="./img/filesMenu.png"> 


 



### Download 

At any time, a graph can be saved (download) in its current state as a JSON file. 

It save the graph to your ***local disk*** using the browser. 

#### Graph Name in main bar

<img src="./img/drafInput.png"> 


### Upload 

By default an upload will try to find and connect automatically the original DB used when dowloaded. 

#### compatible DB 

If this very DB is no more available, you can connect  a compatible one first:    
####  <img src="./img/connectToDBMenu.png" width="120"> 

Reloading your json, you will be prompted for a confirmation: 
  <img src= "./img/compatibility.png" width ="260px" style ="border:1px solid #888">     


**no database connection at all**:   
  
<img src= "./img/NoDetailsNoDB.png" width ="260px" style ="border:1px solid #888">  

### Default if no Database 

If no DB connected, somme actions will have errors or no effects: 

***Triggers list and code details***  
<img src = './img/DBErrorOnTriggers.png' width ="160" style="border: 1px solid grey;">

***Table details***  
<img src = './img/DBNoTabeDefinition.png' width ="400px" style="border: 1px solid grey;">

# Graphical Options 

You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.  
üí° **Tip:** Zoom out is centered on the mouse position.  

You can move the graph by holding the left mouse button and dragging the cursor.

### Menu Display

 <img src="./img/fitScreenMenu.png">  
 <img src="./img/fitAllSelected.png" width= "130px" > 

- **All:** fit the graph to show all nodes on one screen.
- **Selected:** fit only the selected nodes.

üí° **Tip:** If the screen is empty, try ***Fit Screen ‚Üí All*** as your nodes may be far away. 

### <img src="./img/layoutMenu.png"> 

Apply a layout algorithm to reorganize ***the current scope***:  
- the whole graph if no nodes are selected  
- only the selected nodes if there is a selection  

Several common algorithms are available at redaction time: 
<img src = "./img/layouts.png" width = "150"> 

Some may spread nodes outside the screen: use **Fit Screen** or try a different layout.  
Note: some layout calculations include a random component and may vary with each execution.

If you apply a layout on a subset of nodes, the result will be at unexpected place into the graph. Drag this part using one of selected node.


üí° **Tip:** Use **Undo (Ctrl Z)** to restore the previous layout.


### Move Elements 

Native Cytoscape actions are available to move nodes:  
- Left-click and drag a single node manually.  
- Dragging one of the selected nodes moves the entire selection.  

#### Move... Options

<img src="./img/moveMenu.png"> 

#### Resize...

Expand or shrink the perimeter in different directions: horizontally, vertically, or both.

#### Align...

Arrange nodes within the perimeter along a common axis, horizontal or vertical. 

#### Distribute...

Distribute nodes within the perimeter along a common axis:  
- **Horizontal:** nodes are equally spaced between the leftmost and rightmost.  
- **Vertical:** nodes are equally spaced between the topmost and bottommost.  

üí° **Tip:** If the spacing is too tight, move one end and try again.

#### Rotate...

Rotate the nodes in the current perimeter in **15¬∞** increments, either left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise).  
Node labels remain **horizontally aligned**.

üí° **Tip:** Mainly used to avoid overlapping labels.
