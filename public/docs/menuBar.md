# Menu Bar

![All Menus](./img/allMenus.png)

Menus and submenus appear on hover and disappear when the cursor leaves.  
💡 **Tip:** Click on a menu entry to keep it temporarily open.

---

## 🔁 Undo

The **counterclockwise symbol** in the menu restores the previous state.  
You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Z**.

---

## 🔎 Select Mode: OR / AND

- **OR (default):** Adds new selections to the current selection.
- **AND:** Applies the selection criteria **only to already selected elements**.

💡 **Advice:** Switch back to **OR** after using **AND**—further selections may otherwise return no results.

---

## 🎯 Action Scope

### Visible / All

- **Visible:** Applies only to elements currently visible (default).
- **All:** Includes hidden elements—useful for operations like *follow links* to restore hidden nodes.

### Automatic Scoping

- If nodes are **selected**, actions apply only to them.
- If **no selection**, actions apply to the entire graph (based on Visible/All toggle).

### 🔍 Scope Visualization

The current scope is displayed in the status bar, with emphasized numbers:

- **No selection** → action applies to all nodes (e.g., 9 in `democytodb`):

- **Selection of 4 nodes** → action applies only to those:  
  ![Scope 4](./img/scope4.png)

- **ALL mode with 6 visible and 3 hidden nodes** → action applies to all 9:

## 🗃️ DB Menu
