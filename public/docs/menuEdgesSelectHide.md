# Edge Menu

![Edge Menu](./img/edgesMenu.png)

---

## status bar

Displays selected and visible edges: 
<img src = "./img/edgeStatusBar.png" width = "200px">
  **4 selected / 12 total**

Perimeter of actions applies to selection if any, to all edges if no selection.  

---

### hover on edge

when checked, mouse over an edge shows some details
<img src = "./img/edgeHover.png" width = "200px">  

## select ...

Edges can be selected
-  individually by:
  - Click 
  - Shift + Click 
- with nodes by drawing a rectangle (shift clic) on the graph 
  

Selected edges have distinct dashed and colored lines to be recognized 
<img src = "./img/edgeSelected.png" width = "300px">   

- **select ... all** ‚Üí Select all visible edges
- **select ... none** ‚Üí Deselect all edges
- **select ... swap Selected** ‚Üí Invert current edge selection

---

## hide ...

- **hide ... none** ‚Üí Show all edges
- **hide ... not selected** ‚Üí Hide all except selected edges
- **hide ...selected** ‚Üí Hide selected edges
- **hide ...swap** ‚Üí Invert visible and hidden edges

--- 

## from selected nodes ... 

Take in account currently selected ***nodes*** to pursuit with edge selection :


  - **outgoing Edges** ‚Üí Select only edges going out of selected nodes
  - **incoming Edges** ‚Üí Select only incoming edges to selected nodes
  - **boths** ‚Üí Select all edges connected to selected nodes
    - üí°Similar to ***Nodes > Follow & Show***, except this action selects only the edges‚Äî**not** the terminal nodes.


- **connecting two nodes (of the current selection)** 
  
  below three tables were selected, then the link that connect them (including loops)

<img src = "./img/edgeConnectingNodes.png" width = 300px>   

## toggle details N -> 1 

draw an edge **per column of FK**
<img src = "./img/edgePerColumns2.png" width = 500px>  

---

## Label

**font + / -**  : act on edges in perimeter (selected edges if any , all otherwise)

**show/hide** 
- Toggle edge labels of current perimeter (selected edges if any , all otherwise)
- Displays the foreign key name (common edges) or the trigger name (trigger impact edges) 


<img src="./img/edgeLabels.png" width="600px" />

üí°  *hover* gives more details 

### label show *in 1->N edges per FK*

In this representation, there is one edge per column involved in FK.   
The *label show* action shows the corresponding columns on the line.  
As the graph could be very dense, you can restrict by selecting some edges before calling *show label*, like below 

<img src="./img/labelEdgesOneToN.png" width="600px" />.  

üí°  *hover* gives more details 

---

## list 

Generates an HTML file with details for edges in current perimeter.   
The **Source** and **Target** tables are directly accessible.

<img src="./img/edgesList.png" width="800px" style="border: 1px solid grey;"/>

### List *in 1 -> N detailed mode*
( img truncated below )

# data model...

Actions that add information to the original model .


## data model ... generate trigger impacts

- Analyzes all triggers and function code
- Identifies C(R)UD operations that imply impacts on other tables
- Adds **oriented edges** from the trigger's source table to the impacted table
- Triggers impact edges 
  - are styled distinctly  
  - have trigger's name as label
  - have native category '***trigger_impact***'

<img src="./img/triggerHover.png" width="300px" style="border: 1px solid grey;"/>

---

### data model ... simplify associations

For **dry association tables** (2 foreign keys, no other link, no extra columns):

- Removes the association node
- Creates a **direct edge** between the linked tables (A ‚Üí C)
- Edge label remembers tables' name:  source-(association)-destination
- Edge is visually **non-oriented** (uses circles as end points, not arrows)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution for *follow* walks, orientation still exists (for compatibility with Cytograph)


<img src="./img/collapseAssociations.png" width="500px" />

in upper image, *intervention* node is not simplified due to the trigger impact added recently. It is no more a *strict association*. 

---

### restore association

Restores the original association nodes between tables for the edges in current perimeter.  
Note: The exact previous screen position may be lost during restoration.

---

## filter

Filter edges based on 
-  native FK categories :
  - **nullable** 
  - **on delete cascade**
-  extended categories if added 
  - **triggers_impact**
  - **simplified asssociations**


#### Example 
filter *on delete cascade* 
hide not selected 

<img src="./img/onDeleteCascadeEdge.png" width="300px" />

---

## delete 

Permanently removes selected edges from the graph.  

- if only one edge selected, delete is immediate 
  - this is to allow quick visual cleaning of a graph using backspace
- if several edges are selected a confirmation is necessary    
     
 <img src = "./img/deleteEdges.png" width = 230px style="border: 2px solid grey;">.  

‚ùó **Undo** is available for this action as well
