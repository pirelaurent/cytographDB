# Nodes Menu

<img src ="./img/nodesMenu.png" width =200px >

## Status Bar

Displays selected nodes on visible and hidden layers:  
<img src = "./img/nodeStatusBar.png" width = "200px">  

**0 selected / 10 available** in visible layer  
(0 selected / 0 available) in hidden layer  

The perimeter of actions applies to selected nodes if any, or to all nodes if no selection.

## üîç Selection 

### on Screen

Selections can be made by:  
- Clicking nodes individually  
  - Clicking outside any element removes the current selection  
- **Shift + Click** for multi-selection  
- Drawing a rectangle over nodes  

### menu Select 

<img src ="./img/nodeSelect.png" width =150px >

- **None**: clear any selection  (also any click on graph background)
- **All**: select all visible nodes (also available with `Ctrl A`)  
- **Swap selected**: invert the current selection (selected become unselected, and vice versa)  

### menu Hide 

<img src ="./img/nodeHide.png" width =150px >  


- **Not selected**: hide everything except selected nodes  (most used option)
- **Selected**: hide selected nodes  
- **None**: show all nodes  
- **Swap**: swap visible and hidden nodes  

üí° **Quick menu Select/Hide** ( right click on background)

<img src ="./img/quickSelectHide.png" width =150px >  

| unselect all nodes | select all nodes | swap selection |  
| hide selected | hide not selected | swap hidden | show all |

### From Selected Edges ...

If edges were directly selected, may be the associated nodes are not.  

<img src ="./img/nodeFromEdge.png" width =150px>

This menu works only with previously selected edges.  

- **select source**: select nodes that are the origin of a selected directed edge (FK owner)  
- **both sides**: select all nodes connected in any manner to a selected edge  

- **select target**: select nodes that are the destination of a selected directed edge  

üí° **use case example** 
- filter edges by *native category* such as `"triggers generated"`.  
- apply **From Selected Edges ‚Üí Both Sides** this highlight a subgraph of source and impacted tables by triggers.

### Filter By ...

<img src ='./img/filterByMenu.png' width= "150px" >

#### By Name

<img src ='./img/filterByName.png' width= "300px" >

Applies a **regex-based filter** on node labels (e.g., table names). Matching nodes are selected.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** Some browsers may show text with autofill but not pass it to the regex.  
Enter manually or copy/paste your filter.  

#### By degree 

Degree is the number of edges belonging to a node. 

<img src ='./img/filterByDegree.png' width= "300px" >

By default, the count take care of the reality of a node structure, even if some edges are hidden on screen. 

*count only visible edges* modify this behavior by restricting search to visible edges.    
This helps to find temporary orphans, leaf, root but only on current screen 



#### By Native Category 

<img src ='./img/nodeNativeCategories.png' width= "150px" >  

Native categories are calculated at load time and are available to filter nodes with any database.  

- **Orphan**: isolated table, no outgoing or incoming edge  
- **Root**: table without outgoing edge (no FK), one or more incoming edges  
- **Leaf**: table without incoming edge (never referenced)  
- **Dry association**: association table with two links and no private column (MxN relation)  
- **All associations**: association tables with only outgoing edges  
- **Has triggers**: tables with triggers  

#### By Custom Category

Custom categories are added via custom logic. (@see [Customization Options](./customization.md))  

The filter automatically adapts to the list of custom categories. In `democytodb` there is only one:  
<img src = "./img/customCategory.png" width ="150px">  

This custom ***product*** category is created for demo by the `public/custom/democytodb.js` code:  

```js
if (node.data("label").includes("product")) node.addClass("product");
```

A specific layout `  selector: "node.product"`has also been defined in the custom extensions  


#### How to See Categories

Native and custom categories are displayed while hovering over the node (with *hover* option on):  
<img src = "./img/nativeAndCustomHover.png">

### Label 

<img src = "./img/labelNodes.png" width ="150px">  

- **Show**: default display with table name on node  
- **Hide**: no label (a single point). Node size is reduced to this point  

#### label hide 
Below, only *associations* were selected (*Filter by native category ‚Üí All association*).  
***Label ‚Üí Hide*** reduces them visually as small circles.  

<img src = "./img/labelHide.png" width = 300px>  

*(If no nodes are selected, the action applies to all visible nodes).*  

- **Font +/-**: increase or decrease the font size of node labels in the current perimeter

üí° **Tip:** Useful to emphasize certain parts of the graph.  

---

### List 


Generates an HTML file with *all or selected* tables, sorted alphabetically.  

**All headers are sortable** by clicking on the header.  

<img src = "./img/listNodes.png" width = 360px style="border: 2px solid grey;">  

#### Chaining to Table Details 

Clic on a table name to open details :  
   <img src = "./img/detailsFromList.png" width ="800px" style="border: 2px solid grey;">  

Clicking on a trigger number opens its trigger definition.  
 <img src = "./img/triggersFromList.png" width ="600px">  

#### Close Button 

<img src = "./img/closeButton.png" width ="50px" >

Closes the current browser tab : that will return to main graph. 
**If selected option had been changed in the list, changes will apply to graph  **

üí° **Tip: don't forget to close tab**  
>If you don‚Äôt, a later call to the same named tab will update it as expected, it blinks **BUT** it will not come to front (standard security reasons).  
Don‚Äôt assume your action failed ‚Äî check your tab list first.

## Follow and Show

### <img src ='./img/nodeFollowAndShowMenu.png' width = "150px" >

These actions follow paths from current nodes visible perimeter and can bring hidden nodes back into view if they are linked.  

- **outgoing**,  **both**, **incoming**:  
  Start from selected nodes and follow edges in the chosen direction(s). Linked nodes are selected.  
  The operation can be repeated to show successive dependencies.  

- **Association**:  
  When a selected node is an association, reveal and select the nodes on the other side of the association regardless of direction.  

- **Long paths**:  
  From a selected node (mainly *leaf nodes*), find paths that involve three or more tables in successive **output direction**.  
  All paths are calculated and displayed.  

- **PK ‚Üê FK chains**:  
  Follows successive incoming edges from a root node **and** checks that the referencing table‚Äôs foreign key **fully covers** all columns of the referenced table‚Äôs primary key.  
  The walk continues as long as this pattern is correct.  

 [more details : *Quick Tour* ‚Üí *Walk the model*](quickTour.md#walk-the-model).

### Delete 

Permanently removes *selected nodes* from the graph.   

- If only one node is selected, deletion is immediate  
  - This allows quick visual cleaning of a graph using keyboard **Backspace**  or **delete**
- If several nodes are selected, a confirmation is shown:      

<img src = "./img/deleteNodes.png" width = 230px style="border: 2px solid grey;">   

üí° **Tip:** The same action can be performed using **Backspace**.  
üí° **Tip:** Use <img src ="../img/rollback2.png" height =20px/> **Undo** to restore an accidental deletion.
