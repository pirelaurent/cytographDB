# Nodes Menu

<img src ="./img/nodesMenu.png" width =200px >

## Status Bar

Displays selected nodes on visible and hidden layers:  
<img src = "./img/nodeStatusBar.png" width = "200px">  

**0 selected / 10 available** in visible layer  
(0 selected / 0 available) in hidden layer  

The perimeter of actions applies to selected nodes if any, or to all nodes if no selection.  

---

## üîç Selection on Screen

Selections can be made by:  
- Clicking nodes individually  
  - Clicking outside any element removes the current selection  
- **Shift + Click** for multi-selection  
- Drawing a rectangle over nodes  

### Select ...

<img src ="./img/nodeSelect.png" width =150px >

- **All**: select all visible nodes (also available with `Ctrl + A`)  
- **None**: clear any selection  
- **Swap selected**: invert the current selection (selected become unselected, and vice versa)  

### Hide ...

<img src ="./img/nodeHide.png" width =150px >  

- **None**: show all nodes  
- **Not selected**: hide everything except selected nodes  
- **Selected**: hide selected nodes  
- **Swap**: swap visible and hidden nodes  

### From Selected Edges ...

<img src ="./img/nodeFromEdge.png" width =150px>

This menu works only with previously selected edges.  

- **Both sides**: select all nodes connected in any manner to a selected edge  
- **Source nodes**: select nodes that are the origin of a selected edge (FK owner)  
- **Destination nodes**: select nodes that are the destination of a selected edge  

üí° **Tip:** Example use case ‚Äî filter edges by native category such as `"triggers generated"`.  
Then apply **From Selected Edges ‚Üí Both Sides** to highlight a subgraph of source and impacted tables by triggers.  

### Filter By ...

<img src ='./img/filterByMenu.png' width= "150px" >

#### By Name

<img src ='./img/filterByName.png' width= "300px" >

Applies a **regex-based filter** on node labels (e.g., table names). Matching nodes are selected.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** Some browsers may show text with autofill but not pass it to the regex.  
Enter manually or copy/paste your filter.  

#### By Native Category 

<img src ='./img/nodeNativeCategories.png' width= "150px" >  

Native categories are calculated at load time and are available to filter nodes with any database.  

- **Orphan**: isolated table, no outgoing or incoming edge  
- **Root**: table without outgoing edge (no FK), one or more incoming edges  
- **Leaf**: table without incoming edge (never referenced)  
- **Dry association**: association table with two links and no private column (MxN relation)  
- **All associations**: association tables with only outgoing edges  
- **Has triggers**: tables with triggers  

#### By Custom Category

Custom categories are added via custom logic. (@see [Customization Options](./customization.md))  

The filter automatically adapts to the list of custom categories. In `democytodb` there is only one:  
<img src = "./img/customCategory.png" width ="150px">  

This custom ***product*** category is created for demo by the `public/custom/democytodb.js` code:  

```js
if (node.data("label").includes("product")) node.addClass("product");
```

A specific layout is also defined that you can see on the graph images:  

```js
{
  selector: "node.product",
  style: {
    "color": "#6D071A",
    "font-size": "25px",
    "font-style": "italic"
  },
},
```

#### How to See Categories

Native and custom categories are displayed while hovering over the node (with *hover* option on):  
<img src = "./img/nativeAndCustomHover.png">

### Select ... With Edges 

Select nodes based on their edge characteristics.  
<img src = "./img/nodeByEdges.png" width ="150px">  

- **None**: no edges on node (same as *filter by...native category... orphan*)  
- **Looping**: node has a self-referencing edge (hierarchical references)  
- **Outgoing**: condition on number of outgoing (FK) links  
- **Incoming**: condition on number of incoming links  

<img src = "./img/nodeByEdgesCount.png" width ="250px">  

üí° **Tip:** Combine **AND/OR** selections to find specific structures.  

<img src = "./img/and-or.png" width ="180px">  

Example: select *first nodes with 2 outgoing* ‚Üí set **AND** ‚Üí select *no incoming edges*.  
(This detects the same as the *Dry Association* category.)  

---

### Label 

<img src = "./img/labelNodes.png" width ="150px">  

- **Show**: default display with table name on node  
- **Hide**: no label (a single point). Node size is reduced to this point  

Below, *associations* were selected (*Filter by native category ‚Üí All association*).  
Then menu *Label ‚Üí Hide* reduces them visually as small circles.  

<img src = "./img/labelHide.png" width = 300px>  

*(If no nodes are selected, the action applies to all visible nodes).*  

- **Font +/-**: increase or decrease the font size of node labels in the current perimeter (selected if any, all if none).  

üí° **Tip:** Useful to emphasize certain parts of the graph.  

---

### List 

Generates an HTML file with all tables, sorted alphabetically.  
This applies to the current perimeter (selected nodes if any, all nodes otherwise).  

**All headers are sortable** by clicking on the header.  

<img src = "./img/listNodes.png" width = 300px style="border: 2px solid grey;">  

#### Chaining to Table Details 

- Clicking on a table name opens its table definition.  
   <img src = "./img/detailsFromList.png" width ="650px">  

- Clicking on a trigger number opens its trigger definition.  
 <img src = "./img/triggersFromList.png" width ="600px">  

#### Close Button 

<img src = "./img/closeButton.png" width ="50px" >

Closes the current browser tab.  

üí° **Tip:**  
If you don‚Äôt close a tab and later recall the same display, the tab will be updated but will not come to the front (for security reasons).  
You can see it blink when updated. Don‚Äôt assume your action failed ‚Äî check your tab list.  

---

## Follow and Show

### <img src ='./img/nodeFollowAndShowMenu.png' width = "150px" >

These actions follow paths from current nodes visible perimeter and can bring hidden nodes back into view if they are linked.  

- **Outgoing**, **Incoming**, **Both**:  
  Start from selected nodes and follow edges in the chosen direction(s). Linked nodes are selected.  
  The operation can be repeated to show successive dependencies.  

- **Association**:  
  When a selected node is an association, reveal and select the nodes on the other side of the association regardless of direction.  

- **Long paths**:  
  From a selected node (mainly *leaf nodes*), find paths that involve three or more tables in successive **output direction**.  
  All paths are calculated and displayed.  

- **PK ‚Üê FK chains**:  
  Follows successive incoming edges from a root node **and** checks that the referencing table‚Äôs foreign key **fully covers** all columns of the referenced table‚Äôs primary key.  
  The walk continues as long as this pattern is correct.  

See more details at [Quick Tour ‚Üí *Walk the model*](quickTour.md#walk-the-model).

### Delete 

Permanently removes *selected nodes* from the graph.   

- If only one node is selected, deletion is immediate  
  - This allows quick visual cleaning of a graph using **Backspace**  
- If several nodes are selected, a confirmation is shown:      

<img src = "./img/deleteNodes.png" width = 230px style="border: 2px solid grey;">   

üí° **Tip:** The same action can be performed using **Backspace**.  
üí° **Tip:** Use <img src ="../img/rollback2.png" height =20px/> **Undo** to restore an accidental deletion.
